Students should be familiar with  [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/). Please watch at
least [CS50's video](https://youtu.be/NcoBAfJ6l2Q) if you are not aware about [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
and [GitHub](https://github.com/) at all.

#### 1. Prepare repository.

Login to the [GitHub](https://github.com/) with own account.
Please [register](https://github.com/signup?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out&ref_page=%2F&source=header-home)
Account at github.com using your university account if you don't have such yet. Navigate
to [this project](https://github.com/elpilasgsm/sfedu-ictis-ap-sorting) and click Fork in the top right corner. The
central repository will be cloned to your account. Clone your forked repository to your computer. 

#### 2. Coding

In your forked project in the file [main.cpp](main.cpp#L87) please implement methods market with

```//TODO```

There is also

```//PUT YOUR CODE HERE```

placeholder in the code. You should write code only in this places. If required you can add more ```#include``` to the
file, but the existed are enough to complete the task.

#### 3. Validate code

TODO

#### 4. Collect Results
